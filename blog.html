                Ans: Most animals confined in zoos are not endangered, nor are they being prepared for release into natural habitats. In fact, it is nearly impossible to release captive-bred animals, including threatened species like elephants, polar bears, gorillas, tigers and chimpanzees into the wild.

                (b) water lily
                (c) fish

            <h3 class="mb-5 mt-3 text-xl">
                (a) Camel:A camel has a hump where fat is stored, which enables a camel to survive food scarcity.
               A camel can drink a lot of water at a time and then survive for a long time without water.
               A camel does not sweat, excretes little water as urine and passes very dry dung to help minimize the wastage of water.
           <br>(b) Water lily:
               It has long, narrow stems that are not damaged by water currents.
               It has air spaces to enable the plant to float.
               Water lilies have large flat leaves with waxy, waterproof upper surfaces.
             <br>  (c) Fishes:
               They have a streamlined shape to help reduce water resistance.
               Fishes have gills to respire under water.
               Fishes have scales and mucous on their bodies to make them waterproof and reduce water resistance while swimming.
