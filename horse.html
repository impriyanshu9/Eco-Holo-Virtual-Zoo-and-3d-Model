                <h2>Horses</h2>
                <p> Horses, scientifically known as Equus ferus caballus, belong to the equine family.
                    They have been domesticated for over 5,000 years and have played a vital role in human civilization.
                    Horses come from different breeds, each with different characteristics, sizes and abilities.
                    The Arabian horse is one of the oldest and most famous breeds, known for its endurance and distinctive head shape.
                    Horses are herbivores whose diet consists mainly of grass and hay.
                    They have strong leg muscles that allow them to run at high speeds.
                    The fastest recorded speed of a horse is around 55 miles per hour (88.5 kilometers per hour).
                    Horses are measured in hands, with one hand equal to 4 inches, and is used to determine their height at the withers (the highest point on their back).
                    They have remarkable communication skills, using a combination of body language and vocalizations.
                    Horses have excellent memories and remember people, places and experiences.
                    They have a unique digestive system, relying on a large cecum and hindgut fermentation to break down the cellulose in their diet.
                    A horse's hoof is a complex structure that requires regular care to stay healthy.
                    Horses have been used in a variety of roles throughout history, from transportation and agriculture to sports and therapy.
                    The sport of horse racing is popular around the world, with events such as the Kentucky Derby drawing large crowds.
                    Equestrian sports include show jumping, dressage, eventing and rodeo, which showcases the horse's agility and cooperation with the riders.
